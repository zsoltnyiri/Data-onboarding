# Data-onboarding tool

Tool to record video from camera feed, analyse the emotions of the participants and plot for fun facts after the data onboarding.

Takes a picture using the room's webcam every x seconds. Detects individuals, and finds the happiest picture for everyone. Gives these pictures as an output. Afterwards analysis the emotions on all the pictures per person, and gives an average of how the data onboarding was 'liked' visualized on plotly graphs.

Disclaimer: it was written in Python 2, and the Emotion API is probably depricated by now. Consider a legacy tool, but parts may be still used.
